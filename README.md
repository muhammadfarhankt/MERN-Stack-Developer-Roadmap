# 1. HTML:

## Structure:
- Document Type Definition (DOCTYPE) declaration.
- Basic HTML elements like `<html>, <head>, <body>, <title>.`
- Semantic elements like `<h1>` for headings, `<p>` for paragraphs, `<ul>` and `<ol>` for lists, `<img>` for images, and `<a>` for links.
- Nesting elements to create complex website structures.
  
## Attributes:
- Common attributes like `id, class, src, href, and alt.`
- Using attributes to provide additional information or functionality to elements.
- Form elements like `<input>, <textarea>, <select>, and <button>.`
- Understanding form attributes like `type, name, and value.`

## Tables:
- Creating tables with `<table>`, `<tr>` (table row), and `<td>` (table data) elements.
- Using attributes like `colspan` and `rowspan` to span cells.


# 2. CSS:

## Selectors:
- Targeting elements by tag name (e.g., h1, p)
- Using class selectors (.myClass) and ID selectors (#uniqueID) for specific styling.
- Combining selectors for more precise targeting.
## Properties and Values:
- Basic properties like color, font-family, font-size, background-color, text-align, margin, and padding.
- Understanding units like pixels (px), percentages (%), and ems.
- Exploring other properties for borders, positioning, and more.
## Box Model:
- Content box, padding, border, and margin.
- Using properties like padding, border, and margin to control element layout.
## Intermediate CSS:
- Applying styles with classes and IDs for maintainability.
- Pseudo-classes (e.g., :hover, :active) and pseudo-elements (e.g., ::before, ::after) for dynamic styling.
## Basic layouts with floats or flexbox:
- Floats for basic two-column layouts.
- Flexbox for more complex and responsive layouts (flexibility).
## Responsiveness:
- Understanding the concept of responsive design for different screen sizes.
- Using media queries to adjust styles for mobile, tablet, and desktop.

## Additional Tips:

- Practice writing valid HTML code using a code validator.
- Use developer tools in your browser to inspect and modify HTML and CSS.
- Build small projects to solidify your understanding and explore different features.
- There are many resources available online and in libraries to learn HTML & CSS in more detail.
